# Heart Disease Prediction
This project focuses on using machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree, KNN, and Random Forest Classifier, to accurately predict heart disease likelihood and stages based on patient attributes. The curated dataset, comprising 11 medical attributes, reveals Random Forest as the most efficient algorithm with an 87.12% accuracy. The study addresses the global health concern of heart disease, emphasizing early and accurate predictions for improved patient outcomes. 

The literature review highlights recent advancements in disease prediction models, with algorithms like XGBoost, SVM, and Naive Bayes achieving high accuracy, providing a foundation for this study. 

The methodology details a comprehensive process, from data collection to model development and evaluation. Rigorous cleaning, feature selection, and encoding lead to the development of Decision Tree, KNN, and Random Forest models. Model evaluation metrics, severity staging, and disease type classification identify Random Forest as the most accurate. 

The workflow diagram illustrates a systematic approach, starting with user input collection and leading to binary heart disease prediction, severity staging, and disease type identification. The model considers key health parameters, employing a nuanced approach for a granular understanding of cardiovascular health. 

Results demonstrate the model's efficacy in predicting heart disease presence and classifying individuals into stages. Specific disease types are identified, offering insights into the nature and severity of detected heart conditions. 

Future enhancements include a graphical user interface (GUI), real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, mobile application development, and integration with wearable devices. These improvements aim to enhance accessibility, usability, and personalized health insights, contributing to proactive healthcare interventions and overall cardiovascular health management.
